original version included following modification already. this repo should be older version of original if no specification was given.

# modified

because original version creates [No Name] buffer, which has no practical importance with, this repo's version won't do that.

instead, you need to load current windows' buffer when on split.

thus if current buffers' size is too huge, split must be slower compared with original one.
